This may sound Korean but it isn't. This is the acronym of my project - 
#"Tracing Carbon footprints using Artifical Neural Networks"

It deals firstly with the collection of data for carbon emissions from Coal, Oil, Natural Gas and Primary Consumption for the past 2 decades for various countries. Then a Model is built that is trained with data, tested to obtain the weights of each connected node which will help predict the carbon emissions for a particular year and a particular year for particular region.

 
It was successfully deployed in April.
